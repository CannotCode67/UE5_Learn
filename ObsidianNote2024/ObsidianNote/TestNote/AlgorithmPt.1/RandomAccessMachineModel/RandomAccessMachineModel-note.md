RandomAccessMachine Model is short for RAM model. In this case, RAM is not random access memory like what we know in computer architecture. Careful not to mix them up. Random access machine model is an abstract model which defines how the computer should work underneath, meaning what component a computer should have and how they interact to perform the function we want, etc.

Control unit handles simple logics and arithmetic calculations. 

Program counter handles the order of the program execution. 

Registers store temporary information needed to run the program. 

Control unit read the input and the program from the memory, do the execution, then write the output to the memory. 

This abstract model is fairly similar to modern computer architecture, thus how things work in modern computer can be explained in a relatively simple fashion using RAM model.
