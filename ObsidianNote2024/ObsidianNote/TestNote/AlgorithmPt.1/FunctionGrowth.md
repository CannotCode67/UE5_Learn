One operation takes one time-step to execute in RAM model. With this simplification, we can work out how many time-steps are needed for certain functions. 

We count the number of operation performed. However, sometimes, the number depends on the input size, and we put the input size(n) into the equation. 

Then, we get functions like what we learn from mathematics.  

Different kinds of functions change in different speeds. 

Big-O notation measures the worst case scenario of the time needed for a function execution.
