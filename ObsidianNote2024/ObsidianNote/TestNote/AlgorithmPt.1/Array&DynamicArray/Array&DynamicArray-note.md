Array is an actual data structure instead of an abstract one. It is used by the computer to implement features of abstract data structure. 

-its length is fixed 

-can access each element by using indices (starting from zero)![[AlgorithmPt.1/Array&DynamicArray/GetImage.png]]

Array is contiguous data structure, meanning it uses memory space that are right next to each other.

The operation on the left is the vector operations, and the ones on the right is the actual operations array has to implement the vector oerations.

Dynamic Array is an extended version of array where its size is not fixed. However, dynamic array is an abstract data structure while array isn't. 

Below is operations a dynamic array allows.

The operation on the left is the vector operations, and the ones on the right is the actual operations array has to implement the dynamic array operations.
