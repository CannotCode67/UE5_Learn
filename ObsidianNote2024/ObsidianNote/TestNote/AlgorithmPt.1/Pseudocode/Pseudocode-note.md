Discretisation means taking something continuous and turning it into discrete sections. 

Pseudocode is designed to represent a procedure in descrete steps, which is similar to how computer understands a procedure. 

Flowchart is designed to represent a procedure in continuous fashion.

for loops in pseudocode: 

here i starts at 2 and increases by 1 each iteration 

x = 1 + 2 = 3 ---------- iteration 1 

x = 3 + 3 = 6 ---------- iteration 2 

x = 6 + 4 = 10 -------- iteration 3
