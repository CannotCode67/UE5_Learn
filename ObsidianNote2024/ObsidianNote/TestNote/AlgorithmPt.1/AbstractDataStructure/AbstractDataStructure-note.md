Vector: basically array? yes, but vector is an abstract data structure, and array is an actual one.

>a vector is fixed length. 

>we access the element of a vector through index (but it seems to start from 1?)


Queue:

>a queue is flexible length. 

>we can access only the head and the tail of a queue (or just the head?). 

>enqueue would add element to the tail of the queue. 

>dequeue would remove element from the head of the queue.

Stack: 

>flexible length 

>access of the top of the stack 

>push would add element to the top of the stack 

>pop would remove element at the top of the stack
