In game, we often use normal map, but rarely height map because height map is very expensive to simulate at runtime. So, even we have height map as one of the outputs of substance painter, we hardly put it into material of Unity. However, that doesn't mean the details or things we do in height channel of painter would be lost, since the information in height channel gets converted into normal data. Therefore, as long as we assign the normal map, our mesh would have those info.

For baked patterns like decal sheet, we use projection function to add those details. For normal channel, the procedure is rather simple. Firstly, add a paint layer (maybe call just "layer") not a fill layer, then disable all output channels but not the normal. With projection function on, assign our baked decal sheet of normal map, then just project the content. If using paint function, we can use the hard-surface decal brushes provided by substance painter. Either way is fine, but with baked patterns we can add whatever we want, just needing to go through the trouble of making them. Erase function can erase the normal info made by both methods. But print the blank area on the decal sheet won't erase the normal info. 

Now, for the height channel, it is more complicated. Firstly, we use a fill layer, then disable all output channels but not the height. Remember in order to see the height detail, the height value needs to have a value not equal to zero. Add a black mask. With projection function on, assign our baked decal sheet of height map. Now, if directly print the patterns, you will find the blank area of the decal sheet would still create height info which is equal to the value of the height output channel.  

The workaround is going to 2D view by pressing F3, find a blank area of the decal sheet and scale it up until the whole UV unwrap is contained by this area, then just paint the height info to the whole UV unwrap. Now, we can go back to 3D view and continue projecting our baked patterns to the mesh without creating additional height info (which is created already all over the mesh). This method works because we modify our height map in photoshop to replace the color in blank area with a perfect grey color (RGB:128,128,128). Substance painter reads this color as the zero value of height info. Also a trick to check if the mesh is all painted with grey value is to alt + left click the mask, so we can see the mask in 3D view port. This way, it is very easy to spot any missing area. 

We can duplicate the layer, adjust the height output value to be a different value, making the height info to go at an opposite direction. But remember to do this before we print any detail, otherwise the height info would cancel each other, making the detail fade or disappear. In addition, we can add levels to the black mask to modify the height info. 

One important thing to know is we can add anchor point with height/normal details, so multiple materials can reference the data. However, if the detail needs specific material on one part and another material on others, the material would not know. They either fill it with a fill modification on mask or fill it in a way the generator/filter defines. Therefore, in case we need specific material on specific part of the detail, we still need to hand paint it, at least until I find another way.
