One way to do it is to add a mask with color selection, then pick color ID. Another way is to ctrl + left drag the material from the library to the 3D viewport, to the part of the mesh where it holds the color ID we want to choose. While doing it, the 3D viewport would automatically switch to ID. The first one is for materials we create in layers window, the second one is for the materials that are available in library.
