Often, we want our mesh UV unwrap to have as much resolution as possible. A very common trick to maximize the UV space efficiency is to make the same looking parts of the mesh to take up exactly the same UV space, meaning they are overlapping perfectly. A mesh with symmetrical parts or identical parts is suitable for this kind of trick. Also, by overlapping, we need to keep only one UV unwrap in 0 to 1 UV space, other identical ones need to move to other UV space but remember they should locate at the same relative position in their own UV spaces.Â 

Now, when we do texturing in substance painter, we can only apply texture to the parts which have their own UV unwrap located in 0 to 1 UV space. So it means only the original parts can be applied with texture, the copies of them would share the same texture automatically. However, beware that copies' UV should be moved out of the 0 to 1 UV space, otherwise, painter won't bake correctly. Therefore, it is also a method to speed up the texturing process, and we don't need to worry about any added details would not match accurately.
