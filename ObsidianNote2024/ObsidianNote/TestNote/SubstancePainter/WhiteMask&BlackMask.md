White mask means letting everything go through, by editing the white mask, we are doing subtraction. Black mask means blocking everything, by editing the black mask, we are doing adding.  

Normally, we might think white brush means brushing the mask white, so it is adding things. Intuitively, we might think black brush would subtracting things, but it is not? IDK why.  

For subtracting things, we want to use the erase function. Pressing 1 would turn paint function on, and pressing 2 would switch to erase function. Therefore, using these shortcuts, it is fast to switch paint and erase back and forth.   

Also pressing x would toggle between white brush and black brush, but I should find out how the black brush work for the mask and everything. It seems if we want to use white brush and black brush to directly work as paint and erase, we need to add paint to the mask.  

Pressing m key to iterate through different maps in 3D viewport, and it won’t show mask. So one more tip is alt + left click the mask would show the mask in the 3D viewport, it is easier to preview the effect than do it in 2D view.
