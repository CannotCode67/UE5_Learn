When you add a new layer, it usually comes with all the default output channels enabled. We sometimes only need one output channel for a specific purpose. However, disabling unused channels is a little bit of tedious when we keep left clicking at different channels. One way to save time is to alt + left click at the channel we want to keep, which would disable all other channels at one go.
