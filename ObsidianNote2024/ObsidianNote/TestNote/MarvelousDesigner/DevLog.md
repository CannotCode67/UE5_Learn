Targeted effect below, it is like an inflated tent visual effect.![[MarvelousDesigner/GetImage.png]]


To achieve this in maya, we can either use nCloth simulation that comes with maya or use marvelous designer. We prefer the marvelous designer because it is easier to create wrinkles in MD. nCloth simulation has only the parameters set in the algorithm to affect the result, while MD would additionally allow our active influence during the simulation.  

Defining cloth in MD is easier than defining geo in maya, in a sense of we don’t need to worry about the actual geo of the garment, but in maya, we need to define the shape while working out the geo. However, maya has a powerful modeling capability while MD barely has any, which means to define a more complex shape in maya with mesh is so much quicker than to do it with cloth in MD. It might sound like a draw, but geo density affects the simulation result a lot, and in MD the geo density can be easily controlled, so MD overall is a better solution than nCloth in this case. 

How to do it? 

The avatar silhouette in 2D viewport requires the mesh imported to be vertically turned around. Then we use a technique called tracing to get a garment fitting that red-line shape. Tracing is just hand drawing the pattern, so it is not 100% accurate, but with a avatar silhouette in the background it is close enough. Next, we draw internal lines to define the middle square shape, then we cut a hole there since there is no inflated material in the center. Also, because the avatar and the garment is vertical turned and above the ground, we need to turn off the gravity in preference/simulation properties. The avatar imported by default works like a passive collider, so we need a way to fix the garment there, otherwise it would get pushed away by the avatar. The tool we use is pin, we pin the border of the garment. There is an option to attach pin to the avatar, but we have little control if the pin is attached to the desired location and we have no need since the garment is built to fit that shape. As long as it is not in the avatar, we are fine. Also, we should avoid adding bottom with avatar, instead, we should use a garment with pin to work like that, otherwise there would be too many collisions making the simulation go crazy. Once the garment is fixed. We duplicate it in 2D viewport, and scale it bigger. The reason it needs to be bigger is to get those wrinkle effect. Those wrinkles are the result of one bigger garment sewed to a smaller one, the bigger surface is squeezing itself to match the smaller surface, so the bigger  the duplicated one gets, more wrinkles we get. Move it apart so we can see them both in 2D viewport and in 3D viewport we need to move it next to the original one so it gets pulled towards the original one without colliding the avatar so hard that it gets inside the avatar, otherwise it might stuck inside the avatar during simulation. Then, we need to delete the pin on the duplicated one. Last, we use segment sewing tool to make connections between them. Give it some pressure. Mind the particle distance. The particle distance is basically how dense is the garment, lower number means more geo, meaning slower simulation speed but closer to the effect since it has more vertices to manipulate. Fabric preset defines what kind of fabric it is, along the corresponding physical properties. The garment is not 100% accurate to the shape,  any spot that is too far off, we can use a tool called track on avatar to additionally fix it. It works by defining one spot of the garment and one spot of the avatar. During simulation, that spot of the garment would get pulled to that spot of the avatar.
