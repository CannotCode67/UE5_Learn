These two practices are for how to better do object-oriented programming, by making individual classes simpler and more focused. On the other hand, we have inheritance (the "is-a" relationship), which tends to make everything into one class. We should use more composition and aggregation, and use inheritance only when other options make no sense. 

Composition means a "has-a" relationship between objects.  Aggregation means a "use-a" relationship between objects. For example, a car has an engine. Both car and engine would be different classes. A more confused example would be a rectangle and a window. We might use inheritance here because window is usually a rectangle, and it also works. But a more flexible approach would be a window has a rectangle as window does have a different shape sometimes.
