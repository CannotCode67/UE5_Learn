To create tillable texture, we use substance designer. But the 3d viewport is not so great. So we use marmoset to do this job. Marmoset has more control of the lighting of the scene, and does a better job at rendering. However, rendering engines are different from software to software, so the exact same material has a very high chance to be rendered differently in marmoset or painter or designer or unreal or unity. The best approach is to put the material inside the software that it will be eventually going, then refine the material based on the way the software renders it. 

Using marmoset to do preview is easy.
