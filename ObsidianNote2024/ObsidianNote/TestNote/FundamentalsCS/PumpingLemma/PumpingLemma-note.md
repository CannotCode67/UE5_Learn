Using Closure Properties to prove a given language regular or not is difficult. 

So, we use pumping lemma.

only the size of y needs to be greater than 0, the sizes of x and z are greater or equal to zero. 

XY^iZ is not S, it is a string made of components x and y and z in this specific fashion, and it should belong to L. So, increasing number of y (i) would not decrease the size of x and z. Size of x and z would remain as what they are in xyz(s).
