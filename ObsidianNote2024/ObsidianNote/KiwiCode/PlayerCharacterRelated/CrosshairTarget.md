This simple script is attached to a game object called crosshair target under the main camera. The aim target under the main camera is a game object 20 units away from the main camera at camera's forward direction. However, we cannot feed this to the weapon script's raycast target. If there is an object with collider in the middle between the aim target and the weapon's raycast origin transform, the raycast would still detect a hit, but the hit place would not match our crosshair. We can imagine there is a raycast from the camera to the aim target, and due to the fact aim target is 20 units forward, this raycast would always in the middle of the screen, and that's where the crosshair is. However, the weapon's raycast is using the gun barrel as raycast origin and aim target as raycast target. And because the origins are actually different, if the hit point is within 20 units, then two raycasts are hitting different spots. So, that's why we need this crosshair target object to be used as weapon's raycast target.

The script is very simple, just run a raycast using camera's position as origin, and camera's forward direction as direction, and if we get a hit, we assign the hit point's position to this crosshair target. When it is fed to the weapon's raycast target, the weapon's raycast would hit the same spot where the crosshair would even the object is within 20 units.
