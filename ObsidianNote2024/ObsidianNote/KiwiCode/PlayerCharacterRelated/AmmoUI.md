This script is attached to the ammo UI object under the Canvas object. Under this ammo UI object, we have two child objects, an Icon object and a text object. Icon object contains the Image component to show the ammo icon. Text object uses text mesh pro component to show some texts, more specific the ammo amount. The AmmoUI script holds a reference to the text mesh pro compoenent, and changes its text property with the ammo count. We wrap this in a method called Refresh(). Other script would call this method passing in the ammo count as parameter to update the text property. There are four places calling the Refresh() method: when the weapon is fired, when the weapon is reloaded, when the character switches weapon, and when the character equips a weapon.
