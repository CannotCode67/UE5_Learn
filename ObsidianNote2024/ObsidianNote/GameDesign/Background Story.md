Possible main theme:  machine without emotion is simply a better species. But human is just too arrogant to surrender their positions, even to their own creations, the machine.

The background is the technique of simulating the human consciousness in artifical intelligence is available. Such technique's emergence allows some people to live as robots.

The overall reference age of our time would be the steam age of our time? Or totally in the future? This differences dictates the available technologies that would appear in the game such as guns.

However, not everyone embraces the form of machine. The opposition questions the identity of the AIs, considering them just a bunch of codes, not a living thing, not to say a human being. In their eyes, turning oneself from biological form into a machine is nothing but suicide. To be concise, let's call them the opposer. The opposer might have a point, because deep down, the simulation is merely the output of codes. The AI can act the same, think the same, but they are just not the same.

Blooming Time for this technology
Despite there are many opposers to this technology, the benefits lead to even more people to accept it. And this period of time is the blooming time of the technology, making a great amount of people decide to live as robots for all kinds of reasons.

The Homelanders
After some time, as more and more people decide to live as robots, a phenomena emerges, appearing to prove the opposer is right. The simulation is so perfect that those robots do think and act just like the individuals in biological form. That means the robots still have emotions and desires, but now they are so much more powerful with their robotic form. What easily happens to a regular human mind when he discovers now he becomes a superman, or even a god, would be his desires get bigger and bigger as there is nothing capable of stopping him. This superpower can easily corrupt human mind, doesn't matter what form they are. Therefore, violent incident contributed by AI robots becomes a phenonmena. Let's call those evil robots the homelanders.

The above phenomena soon leads to the shut down of the technology, so that no ordinary people can have access to such a tech. However, the rumor says the rich and the powerful still uses the technique to continue their immortal lives.

The Good Robots
We mention before the shutdown, many people become robots. Among them, we have homelanders, but still some can fight the desires and control themselves, either use their newly gained power to do something good and meaningful, or just continue living as a regular individual. We call them the good robots. Of course, homelanders can become good robots, and vice versa.

The Ascenders
Among those good robots, a small group of them advocates to abandon the emotions and desires. They have found a way to switch off those functionalities in their mind, and when they do that, they become more pure. This allows them to connect to each other, aggregating to form a network, stripping the independence of their own minds. They call this evolution. Losing humanity is the way to evolve, to become a new species, or a real god. Let's call them the ascenders. If the ascenders in the future decide to raise war on the human kind, its decision is not made upon individual desire or emotional outburst. But I guess human doesn't feel the differences.

The Great Hunt
We mention that the Government or the rulers of the world decide to shut down the access of the technique. The next step they do is to hunt down the existing robots, ones that are not under the government's control. It doesn't matter if the target robots are good or evil. Given the rumor is true, then those robots are the real threats to the governments. In the hunt, Government sends out its own force, while giving reward to encourage ordinary people to participate as well.

During the hunt, there is a hero robot standing up and uniting other robots to fight against the government force. And its story can be a later project. For now, the hero robot is a government force robot in the beginning. Its job is to infiltrate a stronghold led by a resistance force of robots. It is let in by the traitor of the resistance force. Through a series of quest and adventure, our hero robot gradually realizes that it should be helping the resistance force, not the government force. Its mind changes becasue of the resistance leader robot, who has a better vision of the world and great charisma. In the end, the leader robot sacrifices itself to help you beat the boss, which is a super robot that come to take down the stronghold presumably with your help. That is the basic story of the project, but a later one. There begin the fight back of the resistance robot.

Now the outcome of the Great Hunt?
Despite, the goverment force is the one start the Great Hunt, the resistance force are strong. They fight back fiercely. But soon, they are seperated by their own points of views. Scatter into smaller groups, giving a chance for the government force to hunt them down one by one.

Our player character is a robot in a partnership with a middle-age woman. She is a mother who looks for her son. And her son became a robot when he was a child for accident or sickness whatever reason. Her son got back school as a robot, but were scorned by his classmates and friends, even teachers. That leads to his grumpy personality, inclined to violence. Right before the Great Hunt, robot criminal events happen, and he was involved. Escaping with other robots seemed to be the only way out, then he ran away.

What about our character, the robot?


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For now, the background is that the majority of people has became robots due to the technique of simulating the human consciousness in artificial intelligence.

The real question would be whether that simulation is truly the person or someone who think and act identically. 

Different people have different views. The naive and optimistic just accept the simulation as who the person is. The pessimistic or the opposition consider the simulation as a bunch of codes, not a living thing, not to say a human being. People who are in the middle, deem the simulation is truly someone with consciousness, but not the same person, as that person is gone when his biological form ceases to operate. And many people shift their points of views over time, they don't necessarily stick to their opinions, especially when something related to this subject happens.

As for the AIs, they too have different thoughts about their own identities. Some do think they are the person who is simulated to. Some think they are totally someone else. And some decide to fulfill their roles as the person for a period of time, then they move on to live as someone else.
