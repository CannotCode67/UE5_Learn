We start by creating our real project in the src folder, and then create our unit test project in the test folder. Now, if we want to do a test run, we need to be in the test directory, and if we want to run the real project, we need to go to the src directory. Honestly, keep switching directories back and forward is not a very efficient way of working. The solution file is the answser to this problem, it is just a file that keeps track of multiple projects.

First, we go to the top level of the project, the directory where both src folder and test folder can be seen. Then, we run a CLI command dotnet new sln. SLN stands for solution. Next, we add projects into this solution file by CLI command dotnet sln add with the system path to the project file. Now, when we are at the top level directory of the project, we can run a CLI command dotnet build, but now instead of finding a project file, the command finds a solution file and build contained projects.
