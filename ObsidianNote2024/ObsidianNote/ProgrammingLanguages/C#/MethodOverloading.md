Method overloading technique allows us to have multiple methods of the same name in the same class. C# uses what's called the method signature to differentiate methods. The method signature includes the method name, the number of parameters, and the parameter types, but not the return type, and not the parameter names. When any part of the method signature in two methods is different, C# treats them as two different methods.

Sure, we can overload our methods, but why would we need this? Well, in many cases, we want a method to take in different types of parameters, of course the underlying implementation differs as well, but we want the caller of the method to use the same method name because despite the different types, they are conceptually doing the same thing. You might argue different implementations effectively make different methods. You are not wrong, but as the writer of the methods or classes, we encapsulate this details is what we do. It is not wrong to give it a different method name when handling different parameter types, but method overloading technique gives you the possibility to put the same name on those methods, so you can do it easily and properly when you see fit.
