Synthesized member functions are the ones that if we don't provide, the compiler will offer for us.
They are: constructor, copy constructor, assignment operator, destructor, and some new member functions involved in move semantics. We will get into move semantics later, so those new member functions will not be discussed here.

There is no much to discuss anyway. The default copy constructor and assignment operator's behaviors for classes that manage resources is known to be shallow copied. What is shallow copy? What is deep copy? Go to Video51.
